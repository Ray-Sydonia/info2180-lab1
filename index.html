            <p>Hola! My name is Rayna Jarret, as stated in the title and I attend the University of the West Indies.<br>
                I am a  pretty fast learner and I'm always taking up hobbies. I learnt how to crochet and Knit from<br>
                watching Youtube videos and have many quite a few items.I also like to watch television shows and read<br>
                books, as they provide an escape from the stresses of this world. I'm trying my hand in Computer Science<br>
                after doing the sciences (chemistry,biology and physics) my whole highschool life. Why you ask, well who<br> 
                know but lets see where this goes.Truly though I was interested in the Dynamic Web Development course because<br>
                as demonstrated through my hobbies I like to express my creativity and I see web development and design as a<br>
                to a way to create efficent (and aesthetic) websites. While the back end of computing is also also interesting<br>
                and quite an important skill to have, I find the web development more engaging.
